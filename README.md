# Web Project 1
## Learning how to learn Web Page

### Project Description and its Functionality:

HTML page, styled by CSS, and Connected Third-Party Code.  
The web page contains animations, images, links and embedded videos.


### Technologies Description and Used Techniques:

* Positioning elements using Flexbox.
* Using Keyframes to create animation, effects and transform with CSS.
* Creating layers using the z-index property and avoiding Block Overflow.
* I was practicing command-line-using to create the files structure and upload the project to git.
* I organized all the files according to BEM structure using the @import Rule, and Connected the Necessary Blocks to the Web Page, to achieve maximum Code mobility.
* First time I am creating a README.md file :)
